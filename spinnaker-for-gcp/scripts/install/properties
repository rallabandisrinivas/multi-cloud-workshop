# This file is generated just once per Spinnaker installation, prior to running setup.sh.
# You can make changes to this file before running setup.sh for the first time.
# If setup.sh is interrupted, you can run it again at any point and it will finish any incomplete steps.
# Do not change this file once you have run setup.sh for the first time.
# If you want to provision a new Spinnaker installation, whether in the same project or a different project,
#   simply wait until setup.sh completes and delete this file (or the entire cloned repo) from your
#   Cloud Shell home directory. Then you can relaunch the provision-spinnaker.md tutorial and generate a new
#   properties file for use in provisioning a new Spinnaker installation.
