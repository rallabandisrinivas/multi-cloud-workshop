## Overview

This workshop is intended to provide a modern solution for multicloud deployments utilizing options for common opensource and hyperscaler cloud services.  The image above gives an overview of the main components involved but the intent is to provide a framework to modularize the assets so you can easily swap your application of choice for the given task.  The workshop is divided into three self contained sub-workshops in order to promote consumability for the end user. 

The main concepts that are promoted:
*  Declarative modeling via IAC 
*  Federation for multiple Kubernetes clusters
*  Unified service mesh (Istio)
*  Modular design principles
*  AI/ML driven infrastructure management
*  Cloud agnostic deployments

## Prerequisites
*  A Google Cloud Platform Account
*  Subsequent workshops have some additional prerequisites

## Workshop Structure
The workshop is divided into three distinct workshops to facilitate individual adoption. The goal is to provide a modular platform to include assets that are part of your deployment architecture. Over time the workshop should include additional services based on customers needs. Please provide comments and roadmap items that you would like included into the project.
